### 🧠 Project Overview
In this project, I used Google Colab to build a simple recommendation system that suggests movies based on user preferences.  
This project helped me understand basic Machine Learning concepts and data handling.

### 🧩 Tools & Technologies
- Python (Google Colab)
- Pandas, NumPy
- Loom (for video presentation)

### 📈 Future Improvements
I plan to expand this project with real datasets and visualization using Matplotlib and Seaborn.
